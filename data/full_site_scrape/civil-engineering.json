The Department, with the state-of-the-art, research facilities and very much qualified, devoted and experienced personnel and staff, has been attempting huge endeavors in accomplishing magnificent scholastic outcomes in the University examinations and recruitment of the students in prominent organizations. The department strongly believes in introducing multidisciplinary information in the civil engineering syllabus to inculcate the knowledge of students to meet the future requirements. The department was established to ingratiated the industry and academic relations. The Department is presently expecting to gearing up for becoming Autonomous Institution according to the UGC rules and regulations. VISION To be a premier technical department with teaching, research and consultancy that serves the society and strives continuously for excellence in education and research. MISSION To provide quality education for successful career and higher studies in Civil Engineering that emphasizes academic and technical excellence in profession and research, effective communication, team work and leadership to meet the challenges of the society.
